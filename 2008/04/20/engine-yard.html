    <p><a href="http://twitter.com/ivey/statuses/792179131">As I mentioned on Twitter</a>, Friday was my last day at<br />
<a href="http://engineyard.com">Engine Yard</a>.  Since several people have asked, I wanted to say a little bit about why I decided to leave and about what&#8217;s next.</p>
<p>First off, I can&#8217;t say enough times how much EY rocks.  They&#8217;re an awesome company to work with (I&#8217;ve been a customer) and an awesome company to work for.  I had a great time working with some very talented people.</p>
<p>What it really came down to was time.  I used to laugh when political figures would resign to &#8220;spend more time with their family,&#8221; but that&#8217;s basically what happened for me.  I realized that the most valuable thing I have in my business life is the flexibility to wrap it around my family life, not just after dinner or over lunch, but all day.  As a fulltime employee, I couldn&#8217;t take off the afternoon because Ellie was feeling cranky and needed extra attention, or because she was being silly and I wanted to spend a few hours being charmed.  It wouldn&#8217;t be fair to my co-workers, or the customers.  Being self-employed gives me control over my time and how I assign it to projects, and I <strong>really</strong> missed having that control.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s next?  I&#8217;m back to consulting with <a href="http://iveyandbrown.com">Ivey &amp; Brown</a> (that website is sorely in need of a makeover).  If you need some contract Merb or Rails development or Scrum training, give us a call.  I&#8217;m working on some internal projects in May (see website above) and will have serious time for client work June 1.</p>
<p>A couple of people asked me, &#8220;Aren&#8217;t you scared, not knowing where your paycheck will come from?&#8221; and the answer is, &#8220;Yes!&#8221;  Sometimes being self-employed is a real nail-biter.  It takes a fair amount of <del>ego</del> self-confidence and a willingness to take risks.  For me, the risks are worth it, but it&#8217;s definitely not for everyone.</p>
<p>Yes, I&#8217;m still involved with <a href="http://merbivore.com">Merb</a> and hope to actually be <strong>more</strong> involved in the coming weeks.  I&#8217;ll have more time to focus on getting 1.0 ready, and on the Merb book I&#8217;m co-authoring for Manning.  I think my editor will be happy about that aspect of my flexibility, for sure!</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone at Engine Yard for being awesome.  It was a blast, and I can&#8217;t wait to have some new apps for you to manage.</p>
