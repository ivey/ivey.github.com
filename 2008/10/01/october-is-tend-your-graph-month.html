  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Since I&#8217;ve been working on <a href="http://divvs.com">Divvs</a> for a while now, I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about my social graph, because who I&#8217;m connected to now has a real way to reflect on who I am.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve added a <strong>lot</strong> of people to my graph, especially on Facebook.  How many High School and College friends that you haven&#8217;t spoken with, or<br />
even thought about, in years do you have as friends on Facebook?  How many strangers that you don&#8217;t really care about do you follow on Twitter?</p>
<p>So, I&#8217;ve decided that October will be <strong>Tend Your Graph Month</strong>, at least for me.  If you&#8217;d like to join me, mention this post on your blog or on Twitter, or just write about it yourself.</p>
<p>How does it work?  Spend time in October tending to you graph.  Make sure you want to be friends with the people you&#8217;re friends with. Aggressively purge Twitter of people you don&#8217;t care about.  Move people to LinkedIn if they&#8217;re purely business contacts who don&#8217;t need to know, or who you don&#8217;t want to know, what you&#8217;re doing this weekend.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to do the following steps.  You don&#8217;t have to follow them, you can do your own thing.  It&#8217;s cool.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Pick your networks</strong></p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t had much of a problem with over-proliferation of networks. I&#8217;m on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and that&#8217;s about it.  I&#8217;ve got accounts all over the place, but those are all I check or care about.</p>
<p>If you have more than that, maybe this is a good time to reduce and simplify.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve decided to stick with those 3, and add Dopplr, for reasons I&#8217;ll explain shortly.  I&#8217;m going to use these networks how they were intended to be used.</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://facebook.com">Facebook</a> is for friends.  Real friends. People I know, in person, or who I know <strong>really</strong> well online.  People I want to keep up with on a regular basis.  People I want to keep up with me, and to know what I&#8217;m doing this weekend.  Facebook is also for <a href="http://suusi.org"><span class="caps">SUUSI</span></a> friends, since that&#8217;s where they all are.</li>
	<li><a href="http://linkedin.com">LinkedIn</a> is for business contacts.  If I have worked with you, done business with you, met you on a plane and talked business, met you at a conference, met you through a shared business connection, etc.  If I&#8217;ve never done any of those things, you don&#8217;t belong in my LinkedIn graph.</li>
	<li><a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> is for people who I want to engage in conversations with in real time, or who do and say things that make me think, show me new ideas, or make me laugh.</li>
	<li><a href="http://dopplr.com">Dopplr</a> is for people who either travel frequently to either Alabama/NW Florida or to Atlanta that I might want to see when they&#8217;re here, or for people who live places to which I am likely to travel and that I&#8217;d want to see when I&#8217;m there.  This is a very special-purpose site, but it&#8217;s going to be really useful for step 3.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 2: Go through each network, and make sure people are where they belong</strong></p>
<p>Got business contacts on Facebook?  Invite them to LinkedIn, and drop &#8216;em.  No hard feelings, it doesn&#8217;t mean I don&#8217;t like you, it just means you were in the wrong place.  College buddies on LinkedIn? Facebook or nothing (see step 3).</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: For people who don&#8217;t fit anywhere, either change that or drop them</strong></p>
<p>I have a bunch of High School friends on Facebook that I haven&#8217;t talked to since I dropped out of High School, and that I am almost certainly never going to talk to again.  I am wasting my energy and theirs by being friends with them on Facebook.</p>
<p>I have a <strong>few</strong> High School and college friends (and 1 elementary school friend!) on Facebook that I wish I talked to more often.  So, October is a great time to fix that.  If they&#8217;re in Atlanta or other places I travel, I&#8217;ll be inviting them to Dopplr.  I&#8217;ll be sending &#8220;Hey, so what&#8217;s been going on the past 10 years?&#8221; messages to them, hopefully 1 a day for the whole month of October.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s it.  That&#8217;s my plan.  Feel free to follow it yourself, or make your own set of criteria.  Or just spend a little time in October thinking about the people you&#8217;re connected to.</p>
