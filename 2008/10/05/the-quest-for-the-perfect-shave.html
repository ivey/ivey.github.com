  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>At some point when Emily was pregnant, I became convinced that the<br />
baby would be a girl. I admit that this is an irrational thing<br />
to believe without any evidence, especially since I figured it out in<br />
a dream.  However, the Chinese calendar method confirmed my belief, so I think it<br />
was fine.</p>
<p>Anyway, once I &#8220;knew&#8221; I was going to have a little girl, I had some<br />
changes to make.  Up to that point, I&#8217;d been shaving in the shower, if<br />
I shaved at all.  I didn&#8217;t really like shaving, and I hated spending<br />
ridiculous amounts of money on blade cartidges, so I&#8217;d keep using one<br />
well past any reasonable amount of sharpness.  Shaving in the shower<br />
was the only way I could get through it.</p>
<p><em>How was my little girl going to watch Daddy shave, if Daddy always shaved hidden away in the shower?</em></p>
<p>And so began my quest.  It&#8217;s a quest some men spend their entire lives<br />
on, and other men abandon as a waste of time.  For me, it&#8217;s been fun,<br />
and saved money, and made Ellie not scream when she kisses me.</p>
<p>So, if you&#8217;re interested in starting the quest, your journey begins here:</p>
<ul>

	<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4ezJNJfygw">Wet-shaving Part 2</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPLfCyGMm9o">Wet-shaving Part 3</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufG1dPmVo8Q">Using a Safety Razor</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I sat at the kitchen table and watched these, and a bunch of the guy&#8217;s<br />
other videos. In fact, I just watched them all again in the background<br />
while I wrote this post.</p>
<p>I decided that I was going to make the investment in a good safety<br />
razor, because it would allow me to have ridiculously cheap blades.<br />
(As an example, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Gillette-Sensor-Excel-Refills-Cartridges/dp/B000HY9EHY/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;s=hpc&amp;qid=1223237417&amp;sr=1-4">30 Gillette Sensor Excel cartridges</a><br />
on Amazon go for $38.99, while <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Feather-Hi-Stainless-Platimum-Double-Blades/dp/B001G5HZCY/ref=pd_sbs_bt_1">30 Feather Hi-Stainless<br />
blades</a><br />
go for $17.25. Feathers are some of the most expensive blades<br />
available, and are still 40% of the cost of cartridges.)</p>
<p style="float:right;"><img src="http://gweezlebur.com/assets/2008/10/5/11C.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>After some research, I settled on the <a href="http://www.classicshaving.com/catalog/item/522941/284057.htm">Merkur &#8216;Hefty<br />
Classic&#8217;</a><br />
available for about $40.  You&#8217;ll never have to replace it.  You can<br />
also find great razors on eBay, or in the old guy down the street&#8217;s<br />
bathroom.  Ask him, he may have a spare.</p>
<p>Next, I needed a brush.  I was serious about this, so I spent a little<br />
more than I needed to and got a nice badger hair brush.  You can<br />
certainly get by with the brush you&#8217;ll find at Walmart, but you may<br />
want to splurge a little.  I think I got my brush from <a href="http://classicshaving.com">Classic<br />
Shaving</a> at the same time as I bought my<br />
razor, but I&#8217;m not positive.</p>
<p>I bought a latte mug at some discount store.  It&#8217;s wide, so I can get<br />
a rich lather, and it&#8217;s heavy, so it retains heat.  For my birthday my<br />
Mom got me a nicer mug with a pewter base, which is really nice, but<br />
sometimes I still use my $1 mug.  Don&#8217;t go nuts on this part.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s see, razor, brush, mug &#8230; oh, I need soap.  Traditional<br />
wet-shaving enthusiasts don&#8217;t usually use shaving cream or gel from a<br />
spray can, but instead use shave soap and make the lather in the mug.<br />
I won&#8217;t go into too much detail on how I picked what I use, which is<br />
Taylor of Old Bond Street, Lemon and Lime flavor.  Flavor?  Scent?<br />
Whatever.  I spent a remarkable amount of time picking the shave soap<br />
I wanted, but I&#8217;ve been very happy with it.</p>
<p>Finally we come to sharp things.  There are a lot of blades out<br />
there.  Some are good, some are bad, and only a handful are right for<br />
you.  I personally love the Feather Hi-Stainless blades made in Japan<br />
by a company that used to make ninja swords, or so I hear.  You may<br />
find them too sharp.  You may love the Personnas from Israel, and<br />
they&#8217;ll scratch me up and leave me red and irritated.  For that<br />
reason, I recommend you get a sampler pack.  I got <a href="http://www.razorandbrush.com/Sampler.html">one of<br />
these</a> but I don&#8217;t remember<br />
what size I got.  I know it had Feathers, Dorcos, Treet Blues, so it<br />
was probably the #3.  Maybe he changes them out.  I don&#8217;t know, I love<br />
the Feathers.  I started at the bottom, hated most of them, found a<br />
few I could live with, and then got an amazing shave with the<br />
Feathers.  The Dorco from Korea works well for me, too.  The point is,<br />
you have to try, you have to be patient, and you have to be willing to<br />
bleed some, and be red and irritated some.  This takes work, but it is<br />
highly rewarding.</p>
