Lady Bird died in her sleep last night. She was 19. My biggest wish for her was
that she could go at home, on her terms, and I’m very thankful that she was
able to. 

If you had told me 16 years ago she’d be the last survivor of our 6 original
cats I would have thought it was impossible. As a kitten, she was so weak we
had to spoon-feed her yogurt to try and get her digestion working. A few years
later she had a seizure and we took her to the vet, expecting the worst. She
got better, though - although that’s when we learned she was blind. (She still
caught lizards perfectly well, though.) After we moved, she got so sick that as
I drove across the bridge late one night to the emergency vet, I knew she
wasn’t coming home. But she did, and she had many years ahead.

No cat has ever been able to find an available lap as well as Lady Bird. Some
days my main job was making sure she had one to enjoy.

She was a beautiful, elegant lady, and we will miss her very much.
