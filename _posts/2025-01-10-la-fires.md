Like everyone else, I've spent this week watching the LA fires, especially
[Palisades Fire](https://app.watchduty.org/i/40335) as it encroaches on Santa Monica.

I've been going to Santa Monica and Los Angeles a few times a year for 13 years now, with a
break for COVID. It's where I've spent more time than anywhere other than home. I love
Santa Monica, and mostly like the rest of LA. It's been awful to watch places I love be on the brink
of destruction, or already gone. It makes me want to throw up from all the way on the other side
of the country, and I can't imagine the way it feels to be there.

Riot has been fantastic, supporting everyone who needs it, encouraging everyone to take care of themselves.
Rioters are reaching out to offer shelter and transportation and whatever else is needed to each other.
[The office is closed](https://www.polygon.com/news/506288/la-fires-league-riot-games-offices-closed) so
that people can be home or wherever they need to be, and also to reduce the load on local services as much
as possible.

We also have a Rioter donation platform with double matching, and I'm maxing out all the matching options today.
Here's where the Ivey family is sending money:

 - [American Red Cross](https://www.redcross.org/about-us/our-work/disaster-relief/wildfire-relief.html)
 - [International Medical Corps](https://internationalmedicalcorps.org/emergency-response/los-angeles-wildfires/)
 - [Los Angeles Fire Department Foundation](https://supportlafd.org/our-work/)
 - [California Community Foundation](https://www.calfund.org/funds/wildfire-recovery-fund/)
 - [California Fire Foundation](http://www.cafirefoundation.org/)
 - [Direct Relief](https://www.directrelief.org/emergency/california-wildfires/)
 - [World Central Kitchen](https://donate.wck.org/give/654000/#!/donation/checkout)
 - [Pasadena Humane Society](http://www.pasadenahumane.org/)
 - [Best Friends Animal Society](https://bestfriends.org/emergency-response/los-angeles-wildfires)

If you have the means and can help, any of those links are good choices.

Hoping all my friends in LA stay safe.
