The past few months have seen me spending weekends working on a new knitting project, and I finished it last weekend. I finally got it blocked and ready for pictures this week. I present: a green hat.

This was several firsts: first time using a pattern, first time using double pointed needles and circulars, first time decreasing. There's at least 2 little mistakes in there, but I'm not sure I can find them again. I'm pretty proud of how it turned out.

The pattern was a free one I got on Ravelry, <a href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/my-bakers-hat">My Baker's Hat</a> by <a href="https://www.ravelry.com/designers/emily-russell">Emily Russell</a>. The yarn is Knit Picks Wool of the Andes in Worsted Heather. Needles were US size 6, starting on circulars and moving to double pointed once it got crowded.

I haven't decided if it's a practice hat or good enough to give away as a gift. My next project is another hat, and then some socks. Maybe I'll make <a href="https://www.ravelry.com/stores/yarn-miracle">one of Emily's patterns soon, too</a>.
