I didn't post about this while I was making it because it was a present for
my mom, and then I didn't post it after I gave it to her because it was really
cold here and our pipes were off, and then the hot water pipe burst, and then
<a href="https://gweezlebur.com/2022/12/28/william-henry.html">William Henry got worse</a>...

But I made a scarf.

It's using some older yarn Emily had, Lion Brand Landscapes.
<a href="http://yarnmiracle.com/2022/12/22/first-project-not-for-a-cat/">She
says it's discontinued.</a> It's 14 stitches across on US #13 needles. I got
the bind off way too tight, and there's a little weirdness in a couple spots,
but that's how you know it was handmade.

I didn't expect to enjoy knitting as much as I am. I'm already practicing
purling on a little practice square, and then will see what my next project
will be. My goal is to work up to socks.
