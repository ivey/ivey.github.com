I finished my first knitting project over Thanksgiving break,
a grey scarf for Washington. It was mainly meant to be additional
practice, but I decided it would be more fun if I had a goal in mind.
And everyone knows cats love scarves.

I started over a few times to get the width right, and then just went until
it felt long enough.

I used some yarn from Emily's stash, <a href="http://www.tomorrowfarm.net">Tomorrow Farm</a> Kodiak, organic merino wool. I used her US 11 needles - I'm
not commited enough to have my own needles. Yet? We'll see.

Here he is posing to show it off. He likes wearing it way more than I
expected him to, he's kept it on for hours at a time while he naps.
