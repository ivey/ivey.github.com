Happy New Year. Here's to actually writing in 2025.

My plan is to collect the various links I send to people or toss on socials,
and post them here in a link blog style post when I think about it. If you
[look at how I started](https://web.archive.org/web/20000816034849/http://gweezlebur.com/~ivey/weblog/),
that's pretty much how my original blogging worked - a long running daily commentary of
thoughts and links.

* [Interesting post on RPS about why RPGs default to violence][1]. I think a
  stealth/heist style RPG would be fun, build a team, make a plan, try not to
  get anyone killed.
* [Review of "A Fistful of Feathers", an adventure for Cairn][2].
* [Great write-up on how Yochai does play by post in Discord][3].

I also have some ambitious plans, things that feel almost ridiculous to write
down. I'm thinking about writing a novel, with two different ideas competing to
be the one I put on paper. I've also been joking[^joking] with [my friend Heather][9] about
making a game, and I think I have an idea that might be worth chasing. Wild
goals for a new year. We'll see what happens.
