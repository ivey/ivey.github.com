title: Two Days in a Row
---

There's no way this lasts, but here's some things that caught my eye:

* [Thoughts on heuristics for writing software][1] - I am especially intrigued
  by starting over if you didn't finish in one day. I strongly advocate for
  task sizes that can be done in a single day.
* ["This is not your last job"][2] reminds you to be growing and continue learning new skills.
* Mostly saving this to find it later, [Alignment > Autonomy][3]
* [New Japanese Breakfast album][4]
