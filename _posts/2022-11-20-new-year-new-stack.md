The recent Twitter ... happenings ... have gotten me thinking about my relationshp with the web.

I used to very much own my own presence - I've had this domain up and running since 1999. I've had the same email address that whole time - and my spam folder really shows it. I used to write a lot, and I used to post a lot more, multiple times a day, using my <a href="/blog.pl.txt">hand-crafted blog script</a> that generated a static site w/ updated indexes and pagination every time I ran it. I actually <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000816034849/http://gweezlebur.com/~ivey/weblog/">really like the way each day accumluated entries</a> - I was microblogging way before it was a thing.

The web has changed, and we've all moved to social media and silos and keeping our stuff isolated. I've been on Twitter since it started basically, and I loved it. But now I'm realizing that I miss having control over what I write and what I read and where my friends are.

So, like I've done many times before, I am trying out hosting my own stuff again. Mostly. I am tired of being a Linux sysadmin, so I'm using someone else's DNS and Github pages. I moved my email to Fastmail and suddenly spam is manageable. I'm using Mastodon some, but I'm also looking at ways I can write short posts on something I own, and then push them to Fediverse and Twitter and Tumblr and Discord.

(I also retroactively added posts for my 4 dead cats, since those felt like really important things I didn't want locked on Facebook. I may try and bring more of those over if I think about it.)
