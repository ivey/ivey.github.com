The Ivey Family did our usual "go get
Christmas books" journey today, but we
mixed it up a little, and walked. It's been
our dream to walk to the bookstore for years.
When we first moved to Tuscumbia, we got
to do it a few times, but COVID killed 
Coldwater Books.

I got the <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/defiant-brandon-sanderson/19782133?ean=9780593309711&gclid=CjwKCAiAyp-sBhBSEiwAWWzTnoax9uY7hSht7zIyhGCYnop4nRP9FRlwh23P8oaK0vy0zIde2Fgv4xoCFUAQAvD_BwE">
4th book in the Skyward series, <i>Defiant</i>, 
by Brandon Sanderson</a>. It's time to pour
some eggnog, grab a blanket, and read until
it's Christmas.

Happy Holidays to all.
