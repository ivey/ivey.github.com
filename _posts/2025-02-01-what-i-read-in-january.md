title: What I Read in January
description: A summary of the books I finished in January
---

I finished 5 books in January 2025, which is a little less than average for the year
but feels like a good start, since I normally binge a bunch during summer.

The first was [Cleat Cute](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/7f43f316-cddc-45af-9d5c-eb88893c6e90)
by Meryl Wilsner - finished it on New Year's Day. I guess if everyone started the year with lesbian
soccer smut the world would be pretty different. This was cute and fun and very graphic. When I started
branching out to read some smutty romance, this was recommended a bunch, and it was on hold for months.
It goes along with a lot of tropes, subverts a few, and has a good time along the way. There was a big
"I can't belive she's going to do this" moment toward the end that ended up fine. If you like soccer and/or
lesbians and are into very detailed sex scenes, you'll love this. Otherwise you probably will not finish
the first few chapters.

I read [The Perfect Couple](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/848813c1-3491-4094-82bf-bc8ed767f996)
by Elin Hilderbrand as a mystery, without realizing it was part of a romance series, or that it was out
as a Netflix show. It was fine. It wasn't a great mystery, and a month after finishing it I remember almost
nothing about what happened, but I enjoyed reading it.

I really don't read this much romance, especially all at once, but sometimes that's how the holds list works
at the library. I finished Emily Henry's
[Funny Story](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/10acce6a-fa33-4c05-a3b8-72f8fa3fda4d) next. This is almost
a parody in how tropey it is, but there was enough unexpected stuff to keep it interesting, and some of the
supporting characters were really fun. This is candy, but I enjoyed it.

I got [What The Woods Took](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/e06c7c95-fd68-491f-b48e-d4590e97d785) by
Courtney Gould as a "read this in the Kindle app instead of scrolling" book, and ended up really enjoying it.
More queer coming of age horror stories with interesting monsters, please.

I didn't finish anything else for over a week. I have a lot of things in progress, the inauguration happened,
I got a Steam Deck and started playing more games.

Eleanor picked up [The Mist](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/91506806-26e7-42a4-b3c2-545dfdacb094) as her
Christmas book. I hadn't read it in 20 years or so, so I re-read it as bedtime reading. I had forgotten most
of the details, and it felt like it was as good as I remember. If it's been a while, I recommend going back
to early King, some really good stuff there.

That's it for January. I have 9 technically in progress, but a few of those are stalled. I should have 5 of
them finished in the first week or two of February, so next month's post should have more to it.
