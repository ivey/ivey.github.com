We’ve been the people with 6 (or more) cats for so long, it’s hard for me to process that it’s not true anymore.

Abigail was with us for 18 years. She knew Angus, and Truman. She was there when Eleanor came home from the hospital. She used to come back to bed after breakfast and snooze with me until I got up. She had some amazing big cat swagger. She brought a tremendous amount of joy to our lives, and hopefully we did the same for her. We are all going to miss her greatly.
