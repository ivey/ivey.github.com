In June of 2006 I went to Chicago for RailsConf, and while I was there Emily
and Angus found a kitten. By the time I got home he had a name and a vet
appointment, and William Henry rounded out our 6 cats. Betty loved him
especially and spent many hours aggressively cleaning him.

William Henry loved all things pink and fluffy, so when Eleanor was born he
benefited greatly. There’s tons of photos of him in pink tutus and pink baby
beds and on pink quilts. My camera roll is full of pictures of him posing - he
was incredibly photogenic.

The last month has been very hard on him, and today he decided that he was
tired and it was time to go. We’re all going to miss him so very much.
